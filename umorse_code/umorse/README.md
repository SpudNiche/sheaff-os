Problems 2-7 to be including in this repo. Most of it involves morse code (hence, "umorse"). 

Should be fun! 

NOTE: Problem 2, 4, and 7 are in the current directory (morse_encode.pl and bpsk_encode.c, respectively)

The remaining iterations (Problems 3, 5, and 6) are in the "Iterations" directory.
