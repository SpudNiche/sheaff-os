6 Steps to Security
-------------------
1. Filter -> Firewall (vfw/iptables, TCP wrappers, services)
2. Stop Services -> Systemctl (anything unencrypted ... TFTP/Telnet, rsh,
    finger) 
3. Patch -> apt-get update (apply updates to test machines first...) 
4. Backups -> Amanda, LRK (Linux Root Kit), validate OFTEN
    - cp to a DIFFERENT physical device 
    - tar (archive/compress) 
    - Amanda is a tape robot
5. Passwords -> Length is better (nothing crazy) 
6. Monitoring -> /var/log
    - Look around at last, user, firewall, etc. in /var/log
    - logwatch, tripwire, honeypot

Some hot security knowledge 
 - Break-ins caused by 
    -- open doors, default pw, bad pw
    -- buggy software (not checking return vals, buffer overflow (can
        jump to next point in code that hacker wants to run) 
    -- If you're root you can do all except kill zombies! 
    -- intential backdoors... (China) :/ 
 - Just need physical access man
    -- Sensitive data 
    -- Liability
    -- Physical Infrastructure 
 - Most secure OS depends on YOU 

IMPORTANT DIRECTORIES/FILES
    /etc/host.(allow|deny) --> white/blacklists  
    dpkg -S /usr/sbin/crom (see the process) 
    dpkg getinfo
    route 
    traceroute 

Kernel

1. It's always a race condition

Python

TCP/IP vs. UDP
--------------
 - TCP is reliable, has good delivery, connection-oriented, in order
 - UDP is connectionless, unreliable, out of order 

 - TCP has more overhead
 - UDP is used for streaming

Network
-------
OSI Model - Layers

7. Application (Ports on a network)
6. Presentation
5. Session: Recover ordering for UDP 
4. Transport: TCP/UDP
3. Network: IP (32-bit number)
    DDN (??): 192.168.1.197 (0-255 for each) 
2. Datalink: Ethernet -> "Manchester Encoding" (MAC addresses) 
1. Physical Layer: Ethernet, Coaxial, Fiber, Wireless, UTP, Pigeon

Determining Network Stuff
    - Netmask is a bit mask that divides IPs into a network and host
        -- 1's are the network
        -- 0's are the host
        -- Still 32 bits 
    - For a network, the host is set to 0
        -- Ex) 130.111.0.0 is the UMaine Network (all addresses) 
        -- Mask: 255.255.0.0
        -- Largest address is 130.111.255.255 - BROADCAST (sends info to
            everyone on that network) 
        -- A MAC address of all 1's (FF:...:FF) is a broadcast to all
            MAC addresses 
        -- Number of MAC addresses: 2^48 (too big for a single look-up)
    - Ports 
        -- An IP points to a host (i.e. a computer) and the port ids 
            represent specific processes (Spotify, Netflix, etc)
        -- Usually 16-bits 
        -- Common Ports
            80: Web
            22: ssh
            443 https
            25: sendmail
            21: ftp
            STANDARDS: ICANN 
    - Masking and such
        -- NA = IP&NM
        -- BA = IP|(~NM)
    - CIDR is the new representation that uses /16 /whatever
    - Subnets
        -- Total addresses: 2^16
            Assignable:     2^16 - 2 (can't assign NA & BA) 
        -- Ex) 
            130.111.218.0/23 <-- # of ones of NM 
            255.255.254.0 (NM)
            130.111.219.255 (BA) 
            There are 32-23 = 9 slots left so
                2^9 = 512 total addresses 
                2^9 -2 = 510 total assignable addresses
        -- Each subset needs its' own BA and NA
    - Misc: 
        0.0.0.0/8 is reserved 
        127.0.0.0/8 localhost (NOT on network)
    - IPC --> Interprocess Communication
        |IP SA (server)|SP (port)|IP DA (Web Client)|DP (random - 35k-65k)

Network Stuff in C
------------------
socket()
gethostbyname()
setup socket struct
connect() (returns socket fd) 
write(sfd, r(equest)string, strlen(rstring))
read response
write(fileno(stdout), response, len)
close socket

 - Can be done with any hostname (port 80) 

Useful Commands
----------------
ps aux 
systemctl
    sudo systemctl start <service> 
                   stop             (happens during runtime)
                   disable          (need to boot to make changes)
                   mask             (CAN'T start this up) 

Stuff about Passwords
---------------------
/etc/passwd --> 7 fields (man 5 passwd)
/etc/shadow
USERADD, USERDEL, USERMOD, PASSWD
crypt is a one-way hash (old school - 8 chars max became 13 chars)
