## Intro to UNIX Systems
Course focused on C programming, networking, command-line, and misc. Linux adminstration topics. Final projects included a kernel driver for a custom Morse Code Raspberry Pi HAT and a temperature logger written in PHP/Python. 

Fair warning, this repo is quite cluttered. Please excuse poor commit messages and misc. files. It was a busy semester.
